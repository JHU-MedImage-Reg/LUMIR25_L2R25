## Image synthesis using SynthSR + Vector Field Attention

Please refer to https://github.com/junyuchen245/MIR/tree/main/tutorials/lumir25_VFA for the implementation script.

The pipeline first applies SynthSR to images of various modalities, followed by applying the pretrained VFA model on the synthesized outputs.
